Developed a heads-up display (HUD) software to enable crew autonomy during EVA through an augmented reality (AR) display of spacesuit informatics. The software displays a simulated telemetry stream for vital signs and tools to aid astronauts in excavations, navigation, task and resource management, communication, and risk assessment. The design-thinking, testing methodology, and resources for this prototype can be useful for NASA to further their research in AR, astronaut training, and mission operations.
